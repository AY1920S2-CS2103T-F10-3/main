== PROJECT: NOVA

Since: `Apr 2020`

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked to enhance a simple command line interface (CLI) desktop
address book application for our project to cater to users who are accustomed to typing. We decided target fellow
software engineering students as our users and expanded on the address book into an organizer, hoping to aid future
software engineering students taking this module in managing their activities.

We identified 4 main aspects that can be improved: contact management, activity management, study management and
project task management. Thus, we developed a schedule, study planner, progress tracker and refined the given address
book to cater to our problem. As a result, Next-gen Organization Virtual Assistant (NOVA) is born.

This portfolio documents the contribution I made to Project NOVA. It contains a section on the summary of contributions
towards the project as well as the user guide and developer guide.

== Summary of contributions

This section documents a summary of contributions towards the code base, documentation as well as other helpful
contributions.

==== Major enhancement: `view` command

I added the ability to view the activities in the schedule.

* What it does: There are two levels of viewing (by date or by week). The `view` command allows the user to specify the
date which he/she wants to view. Alternatively, the user can use the `view week` command to view the activities
happening on that date.
* Justification: A schedule that cannot be viewed is useless. Users can choose whether to view the schedule at the
daily level or the weekly level.
* Highlight:

==== Minor enhancement: Schedule's framework

I created the framework of the schedule in NOVA.

* What it does: The framework offers a common platform for the other developers working on the schedule.
* Justification: Having a common framework reduces the conflict between different implementation of the schedule. It
also helps us integrate our features easily.

==== Other contributions:

These are some additional contributions I made to the project.

===== Project management:

* Maintained the documentation of the project on GitHub.
** Ensured the team's documentation is appropriate and free of error
** Standardized the format for all to follow so the final document is cohesive.

===== Documentation:
* Added the view commands under features (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-3/main/pull/31/files[#31])
* Improved the introduction and about sections of the user guide (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-3/main/pull/226/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.adoc[#226])
* Added a notations section to the user guide (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-3/main/pull/226/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.adoc[#226])
* Added command summary (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-3/main/pull/274/files?short_path=d80058c#diff-d80058c033b9f127ec727c18cc84ce4d[#274])

===== Community:
* Shared problems faced with others on the forum so people encountering similar problems as me can discuss our
solutions (E.g. https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/forum/issues/20[1], https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/forum/issues/67[2]).
