== PROJECT: NOVA

== Overview

NOVA is a desktop application to help CS2103T with event planning and managing schedules.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other contributions to the project.

* *Major enhancement*:
I added the ability to add events, namely consultations, meetings, study sessions and lessons.

** What it does: Allows user to add events to their schedule.
** Justification: This enables the user to keep track of the various events they have to attend.
** Highlights: It was necessary to ensure that the user did not add an event with the same date and time slot
as an already existing event. Hence, implementation of the adding of events had to be done carefully.
** Credits: The parsing of the commands made use of the Address Book 3 code with some modifications.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to delete events.

** What it does: Allows user to delete events from their schedule.
** Justification: This enables the user to remove any events that they no longer wish to have.
** Credits: The parsing of the command made use of the Address Book 3 code with some modifications.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to add notes to events.

** What it does: Allows user to add notes to specific events in their schedule.

** Justification: This enables the user to take down any important details e.g. significant points made in meetings
so that they do not forget them.

** Credits: The parsing of the command made use of the Address Book 3 code with some modifications.
