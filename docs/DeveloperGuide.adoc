== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i\1` after navigating to Address Book mode with `nav ab`.

.Component interactions for `delete i\1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `HelpBox`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]

// tag::logic[]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/nova/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `LogicParser` class to determine which mode the user is in when they input a command.
.  After which, the relevant parser is called (e.g. `EventParser` or `AddressBookParser`).
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
// end::logic[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/nova/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores a 'Schedule' object that represents the user's schedule.
* stores a 'ProgressTracker' object that represents the user's progress in their project tasks.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/nova/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.nova.commons` package.
All of the classes under `Commons` work independently.

Most notably,

* *API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/nova/commons/core/index/LogsCenter.java[`LogsCenter.java`] +
The `LogsCenter` is used by NOVA to display logs when running NOVA in terminal.

* *API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/nova/commons/core/index/Messages.java[`Messages.java`] +
The `Messages` is used by Address Book feature and deals with messages to display regarding Address Book.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::events[]

=== Manage Events
The manage events feature handles the events of the user, including meetings, consultations, study sessions and lessons.
Users are able to:

* add events
* delete events
* add notes to events

==== Implementation - Deleting an event
The delete feature allows users to remove events from the schedule.
This feature is facilitated by `ScheduleParser`, `EventDeleteCommandParser` and `EventDeleteCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteEvent()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user does `view t\2020-03-20` to view their events on 20th March 2020.

2. The user executes `delete t\2020-03-20 i\2` command to delete the second event on 20th March 2020.

3. `EventDeleteCommandParser` creates a new `EventDeleteCommand`.

4. `LogicManager` executes the `EventDeleteCommand`.

5. `Model#deleteEvent()` is called, and the `Schedule` object in `ModelManager` is updated.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

image::EventDeleteSeqDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user inputs a delete command:

image::EventDeleteActDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Syntax of Deleting an Event

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** choosing the event by its date and its index in the list of events on that date
** Pros: relatively short to type, greater ease of implementation
** Cons: users have to view the list of events on that date before determining which event to mark as done

* **Alternative 2:** choosing the event by description
** Pros: more recognisable for users
** Cons: difficulty in implementing as certain events may have the exact same descriptions

// end::events[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Address Book
The address book feature handles the contact list of the users. To enter address book mode, users need to enter `nav ab` command. Users are able to:

* add contacts
* edit contacts
* delete contacts
* find contacts
* list all contacts
* list category specific contacts
* add category specific remark for contacts
* edit category specific remark for contacts
* delete category specific remark for contacts
* undo or redo command
* add profile picture to contacts
* delete profile picture to contacts

==== Implementation - Undo or redo command

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete i\5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete i\5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[width=446]

Step 3. The user executes `add n\David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[width=446]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AbUndoCommand` and `AbUndoCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, `list c\classmate`, `list c\teammate` or `find`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n\David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== View tasks under IP project
The view tasks feature for the IP project allows the user to view a list of tasks that were added.

==== Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view tasks mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in 'view p\ip w\2' into the command box.
2. The user executes 'view p\ip w\2' to view the list of tasks in week 2 of the IP project.
3. 'PtListCommandParser' creates a new 'PtListCommand'.
4. 'LogicManager' executes the 'PtListCommand'.
5. 'Model#listTasks()' is called and the list of tasks is retrieved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view tasks operation works:

image::PtSeqDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Adding choice of week to view tasks

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** adding in choice of week to view tasks
** Pros: more freedom to choose what to see as a user
** Cons: longer command to type

* **Alternative 2:** listing out the whole project tasks rather than letting user choose based on week
** Pros: shorter command to type and user can see all their tasks at once
** Cons: if user wants to see tasks only for a specific week will be harder to scroll and find

=== View schedule for a specified day
The view schedule feature allows the user to view their schedule for the day specified by them.

==== Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in 'view t\2020-03-10' into the command box.
2. The user executes 'view t\2020-03-10' to view their schedule on the 10th of March 2020.
3. 'ScViewDayCommandParser' creates a new 'ScViewDayCommand'.
4. 'LogicManager' executes the 'ScViewDayCommand'.
5. 'ModelManger#viewSechdule()' is called and the schedule for the day is retrieved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view tasks operation works:

image::SchedulerSeqDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: View schedule by day and not week

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** View schedule by day
** Pros: more freedom to choose what to see as a user
** Cons: more typing to view schedule for more than one day

* **Alternative 2:** View schedule by week
** Pros: user can see their whole week's schedule at once
** Cons: might be too long and messy

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
